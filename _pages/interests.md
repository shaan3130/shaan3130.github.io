# What I like
I love painting and sketching especially nature sceneries and anime characters. I love playing cricket too and never miss any opportunity to hang out with my friends
Along with that I like to maintain my health by going gym regularly. I have an environment-friendly side too and to serve our mother nature 
I joined Green Campus branch of [NSS(National Service Scheme)](https://nss.iitb.ac.in/home/)which helps in the rejuvenation of flora and 
fauna of the institute.  We maintain a small nursery where we grow all sorts of plants, water them, create our own compost and donate saplings to 
students and campus residents. I like singing too and once won first prize in a singing competition.
