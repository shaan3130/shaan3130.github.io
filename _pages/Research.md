*  <b> <span style="color:navy;"> Quantifying Normality: Convergence Rate to Gaussian Limit for Stochastic Approximation and Unadjusted OU Algorithm </b> <br>
<b> SU Haque </b>, Z. Wang, Z. Zhang, ST Maguluri, Submitted <br>
<b> Overview: </b> In this work, we establish explicit non-asymptotic bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the distribution of the rescaled iterate at time k and the asymptotic Gaussian limit for various choices of step-sizes including constant and polynomially decaying. We obtain these sharp rates by first studying the convergence rate of the discrete Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (O-U) process driven by general noise, whose stationary distribution is identical to the limiting Gaussian distribution of the rescaled SA iterates. The analysis involves adapting Stein’s method for Gaussian approximation to handle the matrix weighted sum of i.i.d. random variables. Then, the desired finite-time bounds for SA are obtained by characterizing the error dynamics between the rescaled SA iterate and the discrete time O-U process and combining it with the convergence rate of the latter process.

* <b>Learning to Speak on Behalf of a Group: Medium Access Control for Sending a Shared Message </b> <br>
The project involved developing an algorithm for multiple agents to learn Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol to communicate through a set of collision channels. Our problem required agents to share information without collision at least once at any instant, which is different from the conventional average throughput maximization. We modeled our problem by posing it as a Multi-Armed Bandit for each agent where it learned successfully which channels to access when it became active. By simulating over multiple cases, we showed the superiority of our learning-based solution over heuristic approaches that utilize the knowledge of the distribution according to which observer agents are chosen. We theoretically proved the NP-hardness of the problem and also showed that it is sufficient to search for the optimal solution only in the space of deterministic actions. We have submitted our work as a conference paper at IEEE WCNC 2022. For more information please refer to my [CV](http://shaan3130.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

* <b>Micro-Doppler Effects in RADAR </b> <br>
I was involved in this research during my sophomore year. In real life, we have sources like helicopters that have vibrating surface (due to engine) and rotating blades. These motions induce a sinusoidally varying frequency in the RADAR signal along with the body Doppler. If we can estimate these frequencies we can even tell the frequency of vibration of the engine and the angular speed of the blades. Our task is, given a signal, we need to estimate the values of the micro-doppler and body-doppler frequencies. For more information please refer to my [CV](http://shaan3130.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
