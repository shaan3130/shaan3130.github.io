Hello there! I am Shaan ul Haque, a third year undergarduate-student, studying [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in/). Currently, I am also pursuing minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I have completed my matric and high school from Delhi Public School, Ranchi.
I have gained a particular interest in the area of Machine Learning and Signal Processing. Currently, I am working in a team with two other B.Tech fellows under with [Prof. V.M. Gadre](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/vmgadre) on Micro-Doppler effects in RADAR Imaging. 

I am a very quick learner and enthusiastic about exploring new ideas and solutions on various problems. I like to solve challenges which stimulate ones mind and require thinking out of the box. I am very much dedicated towards my work and always try to look at any problem from various angles. I was accorded with [URA-01(Undergraduate Research Award-01)](http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/urop.jsp) from IIT Bombay for significant contribution in RADAR image analysis. Academically I hold a strong track record right from my schooling age and continuing to do so in my engineering also. I have been awarded by Govt. Of India for standing among top 1000 students across the country after clearing [NTSE(National Talent Research Examination)](http://www.ncert.nic.in/about_ncert.html) which is conducted once in a lifetime in class 10 to recognize young talent.
