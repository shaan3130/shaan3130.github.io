Hello there! I am a second-year PhD student in Machine Learning in [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, Atlanta. I am being advised by [Prof. Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/).

My interests are in the theoretical analysis of Stochastic Approximation Algorithms with major focus on its application in Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning. I received my B.Tech with honours in Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. 

I like to workout, cook and watch anime.
