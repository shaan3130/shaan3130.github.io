Hello all! I am Shaan ul Haque, a third-year undergraduate student, studying [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in/). Currently, I am also pursuing minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I have completed my matric and high school from Delhi Public School, Ranchi.
My interests lies on the conjuction of Machine Learning, Signal Processing and Probablity and their applications in Communication, Image Processing and beyond. I had been working in a team comprising of two other B.Tech fellows under  [Prof. V.M. Gadre](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/vmgadre) on Micro-Doppler effects in RADAR Imaging.  

I am a very quick learner and enthusiastic about exploring new ideas and solutions on various problems. I like to solve challenges that stimulate one's mind and require thinking out of the box. I am very much dedicated to my work and always try to look at any problem from various angles. Academically I hold a strong track record right from my schooling age and continuing to do so in my engineering also. I have been awarded by Govt. of India for standing amongst top 1000 students across the country after clearing [NTSE (National Talent Research Examination)](http://www.ncert.nic.in/about_ncert.html) which is conducted once in a lifetime in class 10 to recognize young talent. During my undergraduate second year, I was accorded with [URA-01 (Undergraduate Research Award-01)](http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/urop.jsp) from IIT Bombay for significant contribution in RADAR image analysis.
