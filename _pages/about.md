Hello all! I am Shaan ul Haque, a third-year undergraduate student, studying [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in/). Currently, I am also pursuing minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I have completed my matric and high school from Delhi Public School, Ranchi.
My interests lies broadly at the conjuction of Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Optimisation and Probability. More specifically I like their applications in Learning Agents, Communication, IoT, data science and beyond. Currently, I am working on two research projects, one under Prof. Vivek Borkar and other being under Prof. Ajit Rajwade. Former involves the theoretical analysis of performance of average-reward RL and latter is related to joint probability estimation from lower dimensional marginals.

I am a very quick learner and enthusiastic about exploring new ideas and solutions on various problems. I like to solve challenges that stimulate one's mind and require thinking out of the box. I am very much dedicated to my work and always try to look at any problem from various angles. Academically I hold a strong track record right from my schooling age and continuing to do so in my engineering also. I have been awarded by Govt. of India for standing amongst top 1000 students across the country after clearing [NTSE (National Talent Research Examination)](http://www.ncert.nic.in/about_ncert.html) which is conducted once in a lifetime in class 10 to recognize young talent. During my undergraduate second year, I was accorded with [URA-01 (Undergraduate Research Award-01)](http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/urop.jsp) from IIT Bombay for significant contribution in RADAR image analysis.
