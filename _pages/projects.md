Here are some of the projects that I have done along with my research experience. They are a mixture of course projects, techinal projects and self-learning projects.
# Research
* <b>Micro-Doppler Effects in RADAR </b> <br>
Currently, I am involved in this research and working on writing it as a publication. In real life, we have sources like helicopters that have vibrating surfaces(due to engine) and rotating blades. These motions induce a sinusoidally varying frequency in the RADAR signal along with the body Doppler. If we can estimate these frequencies we can even tell the vibration of the engine and the angular speed of the blades. Our task is, given a signal, we need to estimate the values of the micro-doppler and body-doppler frequencies. For more information please refer to my [resume](http://shaan3130.github.io/files/resume.pdf). Soon after completion, I would provide with whole documentation.

# Projects
* <b>Autonomous Security Bot</b> <br>
We developed a bot that could be used in residential or industrial complexes. It not only identified  strangers but also guided people, like guests or visitors who came to the complex first time, to the right destination. Our idea was to use a microprocessor(Raspberry Pi in our case) which would store the map of the complex and data of all the residents in it. When it encountered a person it would straightaway mail the security guard of a potential security breach and if the person was a credible visitor it would guide him/her to the destination fed to it by the visitor. For complete information please refer to the [documentation](http://shaan3130.github.io/files/Tech%20Chef%20-%20Documentation.pdf).
* <b>Image Inpainting Via Sparse Representation</b> <br>
This was a self-motivating project I did during my holidays. I had read about the sparse representation of signals using Dictionary Learning. I searched more about this idea and came across a paper which had employed this technique to Image Inpainting. It is the process of hiding a target patch in an image in such a way that when someone looks at the image it appears to him the object never existed in the image. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/shaan3130/Image_Inpainting) for my full implementation.
* <b>Smiley Face on 8*8 LED Matrix</b> <br>
This was a course project which I did when we were first taught about digital circuits in electronics. Our task was to generate a Smiley Face on an 8 by 8 LED matrix using digital circuits. The idea was that at a specific time only one row of the matrix would be lit and this process would be repeated for each row so fast that to our eye it would feel like the whole figure is generated at once. For more information please refer to its [documentation](http://shaan3130.github.io/files/EE112%20project.pdf).
* <b>Immersive Pedagogical and Twinning Activities</b> <br>
This was a course activity in which we were asked to prepare for any electrical engineering topic we like and explain it to students from other colleges. We had taken the topic of Application of Statistics in Digital Signal Processing. You can find the ppt used for the presentation [here](http://shaan3130.github.io/files/Application%20of%20Statistics%20in%20Digital%20Signal%20Processing.pptx).
