Here are some of the projects that I have done along with my research experience. They are a mixture of course projects, techinal projects and self-learning projects.
# Research
* <b>Micro-Doppler Effects in RADAR </b> <br>
Currently, I am involved in this research and working on writing it as a publication. In real life, we have sources like helicopters which have vibrating surfaces(due to engine) and rotating blades. These motions induce a sinosuidally varying frequnecy in the RADAR signal along with the body Doppler. If we are able to estimate these frequencies we can even tell the vibration of the engine and the angular speed of the blades. Our task is, given a signal, we need to estimate the values of the micro-doppler and body-doppler frequencies. For more information please refer to my [resume](http://shaan3130.github.io/files/resume.pdf). Soon after completion, I would provide with whole documentation.
