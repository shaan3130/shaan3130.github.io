Here are some of the projects that I have done along with my research experience. They are a mixture of course projects, techinal projects and self-learning projects.
# Research
* <b>Micro-Doppler Effects in RADAR </b> <br>
Currently, I am involved in this research and working on writing it as a publication. In real life, we have sources like helicopters which have vibrating surfaces(due to engine) and rotating blades. These motions induce a sinosuidally varying frequnecy in the RADAR signal along with the body Doppler. If we are able to estimate these frequencies we can even tell the vibration of the engine and the angular speed of the blades. Our task is, given a signal, we need to estimate the values of the micro-doppler and body-doppler frequencies. For more information please refer to my [resume](http://shaan3130.github.io/files/resume.pdf). Soon after completion, I would provide with whole documentation.

# Projects
* <b>Autonomous Security Bot</b> <br>
We developed a bot which could be used in residentail or industrial complexes. It not only indentified strangers but also guided people, like guests or visitors who came to the complex first time, to the right destination. Our idea was to use a microprocessor(Raspberry Pi in our case) which would store he map of the complex and data of all the residents in it. When it encountered a person it would straightaway mail the security guard of a potential security breach and if the person was a visitor it would guide him/her to the destination fed to it by the visitor.
